## Simple IP Camera Tool
A simple tool for adding IP Camera controls to a browser window.  Set up to be easily accessible in an OBS dock or a separate browser window.
Gives the ability to export camera configurations and import them later if needed.  Uses pure javascript and does not require the user to run or build anything.

**Currently only supports AXIS cameras using the VAPIX API**

*Big shoutout to [Homer911](https://obsproject.com/forum/members/homer911.300179/) on the OBS forums for providing the original button code [here.](https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/ptz-control-for-axis-camera.117728/)*
